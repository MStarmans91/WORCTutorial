# WORCTutorial
This is a tutorial for the WORC Package. It's mainly written as a
[Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/install). Please start with
the WORCTutorial iPython notebook by running the following on a Linux system:

    jupyter notebook WORCTutorial.ipynb

This requires jupyter, iPython and the jupyter Python package (and therefore
also pip) to be installed on your PC. On a Linux system, this can be done by
running:

    apt-get -y install python-pip ipython jupyter-core
    pip install jupyter

The Tutorial notebook can be run on your own system, or a Virtual Machine (VM)
with Ubuntu 18.04 which we pre-installed. Please mail to
m.starmans@erasmusmc.nl to request the VM if you need it.

## Installation
Installation of all requirements can be done through the *installation.sh*
shellscript provided in this repository. In order to make the script executable,
please run the following:

    chmod -R 777 /path/to/installation.sh

## WIP
- We are working improving the notebook for Advanced Flows.
