# WORCTutorial
Tutorial for the WORC Package. Please start with the WORCTutorial iPython
notebook by running the following on  a Linux system:

    jupyter notebook WORCTutorial.ipynb

This requires jupyter, iPython and the jupyter Python package (and therefore
also pip) to be installed on your PC. On a Linux system, this can be done by
running:

    apt-get -y install python-pip ipython jupyter-core
    pip install jupyter

The Tutorial notebook can be run on your own system, or a Virtual Machine (VM)
with Ubuntu 18.04 which we pre-installed. In either case, please mail to
m.starmans@erasmusmc.nl to request either the VM or the data for the example
when not using the VM. Please state in the mail whether you would like to have
the VM or the data, which is pre-installed on the VM.

## Installation
Installation of all requirements can be done through the *installation.sh*
shellscript provided in this repository. In order to make the script executable,
please run the following:

    chmod -R 777 /path/to/installation.sh

## WIP
- We are working on a notebook for Advanced Flows.
